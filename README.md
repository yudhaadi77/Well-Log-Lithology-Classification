# **Well-Log Lithology Classification - HCML One**

## **Overview**
This repository contains our project submission for **SCALE-UP 2025 Geo-energy Hackathon**. Our team, **HCML One**, participated in the **Professional** category and secured **7th place** with a final score of **0.6276**. The goal of this competition was to develop a machine learning model to predict lithology types using well log data.

## **Project Description**
Lithology classification is crucial in oil and gas exploration, as it helps geologists and engineers understand subsurface rock formations. This project leverages **machine learning** to classify lithology based on well log data, optimizing the exploration process for energy resources.

### **Dataset & Features**
We used a well log dataset containing various geophysical measurements, including:
- **Gamma Ray (GR)**
- **Bulk Density (RHOB)**
- **Neutron Porosity (NPHI)**
- **Resistivity Logs (RDEP, RMED, RSHA)**
- **Sonic Logs (DTC, DTS)**
- **Caliper Log (CALI)**
- **Self Potential (SP)**
- **Mud Weight (MUDWEIGHT)**
- **X, Y, Z Coordinates**
- **Measured Depth (DEPTH_MD)**

## **Approach & Methodology**
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values using interpolation and nearest-neighbor estimation.
- Normalized and scaled numerical features.
- Engineered new features for better model representation.

### **2. Feature Selection & Engineering**
- Analyzed feature importance using correlation heatmaps.
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.

### **3. Model Selection & Training**
- Tested various machine learning models, including:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **CatBoost**
  - **Neural Networks**
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** and **Optuna**.

### **4. Evaluation & Submission**
- The models were evaluated using the **Weighted F1 Score**.
- The best-performing model was selected based on cross-validation results.
- The final predictions were formatted and submitted for leaderboard ranking.
